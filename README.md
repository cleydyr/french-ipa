# French IPA Lab

Static reference site with French phoneme tables inspired by the [UVic IPAlab](https://hcmc.uvic.ca/ling/IPAlab/IPAlab.htm).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL to preview the static site.

Clicking any IPA symbol reproduces the corresponding sound as long as it's present on `public/audio/<id>.mp3`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs to `dist/` (copy of `public/`).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Ensure the repository is committed and remote is configured.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
3. GitHub Pages will publish from the `gh-pages` branch generated by `gh-pages` CLI.

For project structure, edit files inside `public/`.
